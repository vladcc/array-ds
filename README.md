# array-ds
Data structures with an array underneath

Simple and cache friendly. There's a vector, ordered map, multimap, set and
multiset, a memory pool, a bit vector, an open address hash table, and a chained
hash table chained with vectors. Some of the structures are timed against STL.
I used Code::Blocks. You can find the workspace in array-ds/cb_workspace/
